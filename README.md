# TechDegree-Project-2
## Description
The second project made for the TeamTreehouse Full-Stack JavaScript track. We were given a long list, and we were supposed to implement paging and filtering.

## Skils and processes
I carefully read through the instructions and started by first defining the global variables. After the variables were defined, I went on to define and implement the functions as named in the project
instructions.
For the project, we used a couple of fundamental javascript skills. We accessed the DOM to manipulate elements by, for example, adding styling to the paging links as the mouse
cursor was hovering over them. After the paging was done, I moved on the filtering part of the project. To do that, I added a div to the header with a button and a input field
where, when pressed, the list is filtered to a person that contains a given value.

## Extra credit features
Implemented the search and filtering functionality.
